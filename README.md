# Essential rules

- Code must be linted and formatted
- Do not leave irrelevant trailing comments or commented code blocks
- Do not leave unused files or assets
- Don't use `eslint-disable` nor change config files for linting and formatting (except for rare agreed exceptions)
- Code must be pushed whenever possible, at least once every worked days

# Setup

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have an up-to-date NodeJS version (an LTS)
- Yarn installed globally
- Preferably VSCode with recommended extensions supplied in `.vscode/extensions`

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/DabaTech-NabilMediouni/dabatech-ui.git

# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Run the app
$ yarn start
```

**Important note** When adding dependencies or updating them, use `yarn` and not `npm`

**Important note** Create **.env** file and add the credentials I sent you via email.

```bash
# Create a **nodemon.json** file and add credentials
REACT_APP_API_URL=..
REACT_APP_API_AUTH_URL=..
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=..
REACT_APP_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=..
```

# Linting and formatting

- Uses ESLint and Prettier working in pair together
- Linting and formatting are enforced (won't compile unless addressed)
- Formatting/Linting is automatically processed on saving files. If linting errors remain unresolved, commit won't go through
- In fact, linting and formatting tasks are also installed as a pre-commit hook through Husky

# Committing code

- Follows the [_Conventional Committing_](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard

- Feature example: `git commit -m "feat: Closes ISS-1. Ability to login with Apple"`
- Patch example: `git commit -m "fix: Closes ISS-2 and corrects scrolling bug"`
- Major/Breaking change example: `git commit -m "BREAKING CHANGE: Updated website version"`
- Combines feature and breaking change:
- Major/Breaking change example:

  `git commit -m "feat: Closes ISS-1. Ability to login with Apple BREAKING CHANGE"`

- Commits not impacting versioning:

  - Regular / casual example: `git commit -m "chore: ISS-4 Installed dependencies"`
  - Refactoring example: `git commit -m "refactoring: Refactored component"`
  - Other commit types: _build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test_

- The standard is linted and Husky will prevent commits from going through if it's not compliant
- Project managers/owners can release satisfying updates and issue version bumps thanks to [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) by running `yarn release`. This will generate:
- Appropriate tags based on the conventional commit history
- An aggregated `CHANGELOG.md` file update.
